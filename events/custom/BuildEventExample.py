    This is an example of a custom event. It is not an official event, but it can be built and analysed like any other event.
    You can use this file as a template to create your own custom events.
    To do so, copy and paste this file, rename it (e.g. BuildEventMyEvent.py), and modify the code in the reBuildEvent function.
    Make sure to change the EVENTS_NAME variable and the docstring of the reBuildEvent function to describe your event and its parameters.
    If multiple events are created in one rebuild function, all will have this description.

    Rebuilds the appropriate event for all animals in the database.

    Parameters
    ----------
    connection : sqlite3.Connection
        The SQLite database connection.
    file : Any or None, optional
        The file path or object.
        Can be used by EventTimeLineCached to cache event loading.
        Default is None.
    tmin : int or None, optional
        Start time for detections (in frame). If None, it will load all
        detections from the start.
    tmax : int or None, optional
        End time for detections (in frame). If None, it will load all
        detections until the end.
    pool : AnimalPool or None, optional
        AnimalPool instance (create new one if None, using tmin and tmax).
    animalType : AnimalType, optional
        The appropriate animal type. Default is MOUSE.
    YOUR_VARIABLES : type
        Description of your variables.
